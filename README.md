# ROAD-ACCIDENT-ANALYSIS
Introduction:

Road accidents pose a significant threat to public safety and are a leading cause of injury and mortality worldwide. Despite advancements in road safety measures, the frequency and severity of road accidents continue to present formidable challenges for policymakers, transportation authorities, and communities alike. In light of this, a comprehensive analysis of road accidents is imperative to identify underlying factors contributing to their occurrence and severity, thereby informing evidence-based interventions aimed at reducing their impact and improving road safety outcomes.

Problem Statement:

The analysis aims to investigate the patterns and determinants of road accidents, with a focus on understanding the prevalence and severity of accidents across different vehicle types, speed limits, road surface conditions, and weather conditions. Specifically, the analysis seeks to address the following key questions:

What are the predominant factors contributing to fatal, serious, and slight accidents on the road?
How do road surface conditions, such as dry, wet, or damp surfaces, impact the occurrence and severity of road accidents?
What role do weather conditions, including fine weather, rain, snow, and frost, play in influencing road safety outcomes?
Are there discernible trends in accident severity across different vehicle types and speed limits?
Based on the analysis findings, what recommendations can be proposed to mitigate the occurrence and severity of road accidents and improve overall road safety?
By examining these questions, the analysis aims to provide insights into the complex dynamics of road accidents and offer actionable recommendations for policymakers, transportation authorities, and stakeholders to implement targeted interventions aimed at reducing road accidents and enhancing road safety for all road users.

Methodology:

After reviewing the data in Excel to understand the assignment, I imported the data into Python using the read_csv function for analysis. The process involved data cleaning, sorting, exploratory data analysis, and writing back to Excel to visualize changes. Subsequently, I returned to Excel to plot pivot tables with the cleaned data to emphasize key factors.

Data Collection and Sources:
This project serves as a culmination of my business/data analysis skills as a certified analyst. The data was collected from various sources to validate analytical capabilities.

Data Cleaning and Restructuring:
Upon importing the necessary libraries and reading the data, it was evident that the dataset was disorganized, containing null values, blank cells, and inconsistently formatted columns. To enhance clarity and understanding, irrelevant columns such as Accident Date, Junction Detail, Number of Vehicles, Police Force, and Time Carriageway Hazards were dropped. The remaining columns were rearranged based on their relevance. Additionally, null values and blank cells were removed to ensure data integrity.
